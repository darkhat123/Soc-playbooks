A vulnerable Windows 10 machine has been compromised through brute forcing a known users weak password and has resulted in the attacker gaining access to the user account and all of the resources and privileges, the attacker has used suspicious powershell execution commands
to execute base64 commands to enumerate the machine and determine their method of privilege escalation. Finally the attacker has utilised the admin account to download mimikatz and per4form credential dumping for the local accounts on the machine
